                <p>ResumeGPT is an AI-powered job recommendation tool designed to help job seekers find the perfect opportunities based on their unique qualifications and career goals. By uploading your resume, ResumeGPT creates a custom AI model that analyzes your experience, skills, and preferences to recommend the most relevant job listings. It doesn't just suggest rolesâ€”it engages in dynamic conversations, answering your questions about specific jobs, roles, and career progression based on your resume.</p>

                    Determine SLA Violations using Machine Learning
                </div>
                <p>Presented at the Interational Conference on Healthcare and Technical Research (ICHTR) 2023, this paper used a Random Forest algorithm to predict potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations based on user cloud configurations. The research was recognized with the Best Presenter Award at the conference.</p>

                    Optimization Algorithms in Machine Learning

                <p><a href="/resources/ICACCP_2023_paper_4799.pdf">This</a> is a paper on 'optimization algorithms in machine learning' that I worked on under the guidance of Prof. Sanjay Singh in my time as a research intern at MIT Manipal. The manuscript was accepted for oral presentation at the International Conference on Advanced Computational and Communication Paradigms (<a href="https://www.icaccpa.in/">ICACCP 2023</a>) and is published in the Springer LNNS series in addition to being SCOPUS-indexed.</p>

                <p>This is a tool that tracks your hands while moving. The hand is mapped to 21 different points, which can each be used for further processing. Having made it using the mediapipe library in the Python programming language, I plan to train the mdoel to recognise 26 letters of the english alphabet.</p>
